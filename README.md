Project Board: https://github.com/users/willsephton/projects/1


- Collaboration between the team through Discord (for voice) and GitHub (for code)
- Deployment of the website will be carried out using Docker containers and a Jetty bridge to allow WAR files to be deployed without hard coding them onto the VM every time
- Map is integrated using leaflet and OpenStreetMaps
- The REST API will be created using spring to allow the use of stubs which will let us work collaboratively without having the code completed

Security:
- A hashing algorithm will be used in between the database and the web application.
- Fail2Ban has been installed on the VM to stop brute forcing into the VM through SSH

Group Work Flow: 
- Meetings every Sunday and Monday to review progress and help each other out with any errors.
