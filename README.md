Deployment of the website will be carried out using docker containers and a jetty bridge to allow WAR files to be deployed without hard coding them onto the VM every time
Map is integrated using leaflet and OpenStreetMaps
The REST API will be created using spring to allow the use of stubs which will let us work collaboratively without having the code completed

Security:
- A hashing algorithm will be used in between the database and the web application.
Fail2Ban has been installed on the VM to stop brute forcing into the VM through SSH

Group Work Flow:
